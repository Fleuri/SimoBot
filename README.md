To create and autodeploy a feature, create a new class SomethingFeature, implement the interface IFeature,
do whatever you need to in the three functions. Look at ReverseFeature for a more in depth explanation on what to do
and if you just want to get to work copy the NiksiFeature thingy and overwrite the stuff with your own.
